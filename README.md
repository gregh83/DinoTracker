## Environment
This application was tested with:
- Python 3.13.5
- PyTorch 2.9.0
- PyQt6 6.9.1
- NumPy 2.2.6
- pyqtgraph 0.13.7
- PIL 11.3.0
- h5py 3.14.0

## Environment Setup
To make this application accessible to researchers from different backgrounds, we provide a 
step‑by‑step illustrated guide for setting up the Python environment. This guide was created 
based on feedback from early testers and is available here: /docs/Installation_guide.pdf.

## Training Process and Hardware

The training of this application was performed on an **Apple Mac Studio** equipped with:

- Apple M2 Ultra  
- 24‑core CPU  
- 76‑core GPU  
- 32‑core Neural Engine  
- 192 GB unified memory  
- 8 TB SSD storage  

The code is optimized to take advantage of the large unified memory available on this system.  
For users without access to such hardware, an **alternative data loader** is provided to enable training on machines with more limited resources.

On Apple Silicon systems, the recommended backend is:
device = torch.device("mps")

On other platforms, replace "mps" with "cpu" or "cuda" depending on availability:
device = torch.device("cpu")   # for CPU-only systems
device = torch.device("cuda")  # for NVIDIA GPU systems
